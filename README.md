I can currently a Student at TripleTen studying BI analytics and data science. I wanted to get into this field for many difrent reasons. Mainly the opportunity was too good to pass up and I dont know the direction i want to take in life is yet. 
I am instrested in leanring new things and my ambition to work and successed in anything I want to do will show in this field becasue of the expertise ceiling there is in the this career.



Something to get to know me
- I can understand new topics quickly
- I am very outgoing and like to make new friends
- I enjoy exercising
- I love dogs
- google sheets / excel is a difficult topic for me
